# Hey there! 👋

Product Owner by day, digital architect by night. Currently wrangling backlogs and building cool stuff in the Netherlands, though my heart occasionally wanders to the land of endless coffee refills and optimism 🇺🇸

**What I'm up to:**
- Turning stakeholder chaos into actionable sprints ✨
- Building products people might actually use (fingers crossed)
- Convincing developers that "just one small change" is never small
- Living the American dream: working remotely in sweatpants while pretending to be professional

*"In God we trust, all others must bring data"* - probably something I'd say in a sprint review
